# MP3Downloader

These are two projects that allow downloading music directly from YouTube.
We have two versions:

ConsoleVersion:
	A lighter and less resource-intensive version, perfect for low-spec computers.

GraphicVersion:
	A version with a graphical interface that performs the same function as the console version. It's a cleaner and more modern version.

The .py files contain the raw code, but within the "Dist" folder, there is the executable. This executable allows the correct execution of the programs without the need for the prior installation of the libraries required by the program.
