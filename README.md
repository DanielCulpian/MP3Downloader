# MP3Downloader

These are two projects that allow downloading music directly from YouTube.
We have two versions:

ConsoleVersion:
	A lighter and less resource-intensive version, perfect for low-spec computers.

GraphicVersion:
	A version with a graphical interface that performs the same function as the console version. It's a cleaner and more modern version.
